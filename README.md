## Exploratory Data Analysis on Suicides in India
### Overview
This project focuses on exploring and analyzing the yearly suicide data of all the states/union territories (U.T.) of India from 2001 to 2012. The dataset contains various parameters related to suicides, including state-wise details, types of suicides, gender, age groups, and total counts.

### Dataset Description
- Source: The dataset used in this project contains suicide details obtained from [source link].
- Contents: The dataset includes information such as State/UT, Year, Type_code, Type, Gender, Age_group, and Total suicides.
- Time Period: Data spans from 2001 to 2012.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### The exploratory data analysis performed on the dataset includes:
- Summary statistics of the data.
- Visualizations depicting trends and patterns in suicides over the years.
- Distribution of suicides across different states/UTs.
- Analysis of suicide types, gender, and age groups.

### Tools and Libraries Used
- Python programming language
- Pandas for data manipulation and analysis
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization
